I am a C++98/11/14/17/20/bleeding edge developer who is made in 1 October, 1997.

#Libs:
* GUI: Qt5, Wt++
* Image libraries: OpenCV, leptonica, Tesseract, ImageMagick
* Unit-tests: Google Test, Boost.Test, Catch2
* Other: a lot of different things :)

#Tools:
* OS: Windows(XP,7,8,8.1,10), Linux-based (Mint, OpenSuse, Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora)
* IDE: Intelij IDEA-based(CLion), Visual Studio (2010/2012/2015/2017/2019), CodeBlocks, Dev-C++
* Compilers: Clang (Apple Clang too), GCC, MSVC, Intel C++ compiler
* Static analysis: PVS-Studio, Clang Static Analyzer, Clang Tidy, CppCheck, Coverity, SonarQube
* VCS: git(git-bash, TortoiseGit, git-cui, GitKraken), SVN(bash, TortoiseSVN)
* Code review: Gerrit, GitHub-integrated
* Fuzzers: AFL, LibFuzzer
* Profilers: Visual Studio built-in, Intel Vtune, Valgrind, CodeXL, Instruments (a little bit), perf, heaptrack
* Sanitizers: Google sanitizers (undefined, address, thread, etc.)
* CI: TeamCity, TravisCI, Appveyor
* Issue tracker: JIRA, Phabricator

#Other languages:
* Python (I use it instead of Bash :)
* C# (I've have some experience in desktop GUI development)
* English: Intermediate - Upper Intermediate (really idk :)

#Open source activities:
* C++: work with Russian WG21: writing/reviewing proposals
* Conan (Bincrafters): packaging several libraries for Conan package manager - packed a lot of different libraries (espessialy image libraries)
* Boost: added several algorithms to Boost.Algorithm library
* Clang: work on static analysis tools (Clang Tidy, Clang Static Analyzer)
* gImageReader: implemented better PDF support
* A lot of small fixes in several libraries and applications (see GitHub account history)

#Other achievements:
* Regular speaker on CoreHard conferences
* Volunteering on CppNow 2017 && CppNow 2019 in Aspen, Colorado, USA
* Volunteering on CppCon 2018 in Bellevue, Washington, USA

#Work experience:
* Feb 2018 - NOW: Solarwinds. Work on Cloud To Cloud backup solution. Solution performs cloud backup for several Microsoft solutions like Exchange, OneDrive, SharePoint. Use: C++14, CMake, gtest, google sanitizers, fuzzers (AFL, LibFuzzer), Gerrit, Git.
* Feb 2017 - Feb 2018: CIB Software, CIB Optical Character Recognition (CIB OCR). Lbrary provides extended optical character recognition solution based on open-source Tesseract library. I've extended image preprocessing before OCR. Worked on architecture design, implementing new functionality, bug fixing, unit and manual testing, planning work, collecting requirements from clients, maintaining and releasing the library. Used: C++11, CMake, tesseract. Supported platforms: Windows 32/64, Linux 32/64, AIX, Solaris, Android 32/64.
* Feb 2017 - Feb 2018: CIB Software, CIB Image Processing Library (CIB IPL). Library performs different image processing algorithms like different binarizations, deskew, automatic rotating, autocrop, etc. Also I've worked on implementing Mixed Raster Compression (MRC) for PDF archiving. Mostly worked on architecture design, implementing new functionality, bug fixing, unit and manual testing, planning work, collecting requirements from clients, maintaining and releasing the library. Used: C++11, CMake, OpenCV, ImageMagick, leptonica, google-sanitizers, valgrind, gtest, etc. Supported platforms: Windows 32/64, Linux 32/64, AIX, Solaris, Android 32/64.
* June 2016 - Feb 2017: CIB Software, CIB PDF Brewer project - the application for making PDF documents from Microsoft Office (and other offices) products with some interesting PDF features. Worked mostly on bug fixing and implementing new functionality, manual testing. Used: C++11, C#, WinAPI. Supported platforms: Windows, Linux.
