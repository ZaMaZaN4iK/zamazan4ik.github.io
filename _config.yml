  Hi, my name is Alex and I'm a yet another software engineer. I am mostly interested in developing any kind of robust modern applications (games, cloud-native apps, whatever else). Also I really like to administrate Linux-based systems (probably some piece of my soul was a DevOooooops in a previous life :)

  I am most skilled in: <mark>C++</mark>. If you are interested in my skills in OS/Tools/PLs/any_other_buzzword, so this list is for you:
    - Languages: C++, Rust. Also have some experience with C#, Java, Python, Bash
    - Boring languages: Russian (native), English (really I don't the exact level. I think it's something like Intermediate-Upper Intermediate)
    - OS: Linux (Debian and RedHat based, mostly Fedora), Windows (since XP). Prefer Linux as a workstation. Have experiance with maintaing own home-based Linux server. At work also have experience with administarting Linux-based machines (on-premise and EC2-based instances)
    - Target OS: Since I am a C++ developer, usually I write cross-platform programs. I have experience with native applications for Linux-based, Windows-based, FreeBSD, macOS, Android, iOS, AIX, Solaris
    - Containers: Docker, podman, containerd, a little-bit CRI-U
    - Orchestration: Kubernetes (minikube, k3s, kubeadm). At home maintain my own on-premise k8s single-node cluster for pet projects. Related to k8s projects, which I use or used: calico, cilium, Helm, ArgoCD
    - Virtualization: Vagrant, VirtualBox, KVM, qemu
    - Automation: Ansible, k6
    - IDE: Vusual Studio (since 2010), CLion. Prefer CLion as a default IDE (even if I hate Java :). Also have some experience with Qt Creator, Dev-C++, Eclipse, NetBeans, all Intelij-IDEA-based IDEs
    - Compilers: Clang, GCC, MSVC, a little bit ICC and EDG, rustc. Mostly use GCC, Clang and rustc
    - Static analysis: PVS-Studio, Clang Static Analyzer, Clang Tidy, CppCheck. Have experience with implementing own Clang-Tidy checks
    - VCS: git (console, TortoiseGit, GitKraken, integrated into CLion), SVN, Gerrit, GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, self-hosted Gitea. And yeah - I know the difference between git and GitHub :)
    - Fuzzers: AFL, LibFuzzer. Have experience with implementing fuzzer checks in production
    - Sanitizers: Google sanitizers, Valgrind
    - Profilers: Intel VTune, perf, heaptrack, CodeXL, Valgrind
    - Dependency managers: Conan, Cargo
    - CI: TeamCity, TravisCI, Appveyor, GitHub Actions
    - Task trackers: JIRA, Phabricator, GitHub projects
    - Cloud providers: AWS (ECS, SNS, SQS, SES)
    - Libraries: Oh... I've used so many libraries that there is no reason to list them here. Just ask me :)

          - CIB PDF Brewer - Windows desktop application which works with printers. Also was integrated into MS Office application as an addin.
          - CIB OCR - own Tesseract-based OCR system with several enchancements
          - CIB IPL - proprietary OpenCV-based library with different classic computer vision algorithm. My own project - PRLib - was mostly inspired by IPL: [link](https://github.com/ZaMaZaN4iK/prlib)

      I really love all kind of open source projects, so trying to do something fine :)
      - In the past was an active Russian WG21 member (C++ standardization committee): writing and reviewing proposals
      - Conan (Bincrafters): packaging several libraries for Conan package manager - packed a lot of different libraries (especialyl core image libraries)
      - Boost: added several algorithms to Boost.Algorithm library
      - Clang: work on static analysis tools (Clang Tidy, Clang Static Analyzer, my own analyzer as a diploma project)
      - gImageReader: implemented better PDF support
      - A lot of small fixes in several libraries and applications (see GitHub account history)
