  Hi, my name's Alexander and I'm a yet another software engineer. I am mostly interested in developing any kind of robust modern applications (games, cloud-native apps, whatever). Also I really like to administrate Linux-servers (probably some piece of my soul was a DevOooooops in a previous life :)

  I am most skilled in: <mark>C++</mark>. If you are interested in my skills in OS/Tools/PLs/any_other_buzzword, so that list is for you: Windows (since XP), Linux(Debian and RedHat based, mostly Fedora), docker, podman, containerd, Kubernetes, Helm, ArgoCD, vagrant, VirtualBox, KVM, qemu, Vusual Studio (since 2010), CLion, Clang, GCC, MSVC, ICC, PVS-Studio, Clang Static Analyzer, Clang Tidy. CppCheck, git (console, TortoiseGit, GitKraken, CLion), SVN, Gerrit, GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, Gitea, AFL, LibFuzzer, Intel VTune, perf, heaptrack, CodeXL, Google sanitizers, TeamCity, TravisCI, Appveyor, GitHub Actions, JIRA, Phabricator, C++, Rust, a little bit of Python/C#/Bash. And I can continue :)

      I really love all kind of open source projects, so trying to something to do something fine :)
      - In the past was an active Russiam WG21 member (C++ standardization committee): writing and reviewing proposals
      - Conan (Bincrafters): packaging several libraries for Conan package manager - packed a lot of different libraries (espessialy image libraries)
      - Boost: added several algorithms to Boost.Algorithm library
      - Clang: work on static analysis tools (Clang Tidy, Clang Static Analyzer, my own analyzer as a diploma project)
      - gImageReader: implemented better PDF support
      - A lot of small fixes in several libraries and applications (see GitHub account history)
